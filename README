This is a repository for my raspberry Pi experiments that I have blogged about on https://bhavyanshu.me. You can refer to this repository if you want to look at the experimental code.        
I try to write as much code in C as possible instead of Python.     

TemperaturePi - Logs temperature into log file which is read using jquery. [Status : Incomplete].
