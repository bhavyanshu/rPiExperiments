This is a repository for my raspberry Pi experiments that I have blogged about on https://bhavyanshu.me. You can refer to this repository if you want to look at the experimental code.        
I try to write as much code in C as possible instead of Python.     

[TemperaturePi](https://github.com/bhavyanshu/rPiExperiments/tree/master/TemperaturePi) - Logs temperature into log file (JSON format) which can be read using jquery ajax.
