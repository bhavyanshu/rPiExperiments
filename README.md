This is a repository for my raspberry Pi experiments that I have blogged about on https://bhavyanshu.me. You can refer to this repository if you want to look at the experimental code.        
I try to write as much code in C as possible instead of Python.     

* [TemperaturePi](https://github.com/bhavyanshu/rPiExperiments/tree/master/TemperaturePi) - Logs temperature into log file (JSON format) which can be read using jquery ajax. Meant to be used with DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor probe.

* [PIR Sensor](https://github.com/bhavyanshu/rPiExperiments/tree/master/PIRsensor) - C and Python implementation for PIR sensor. Detects movement, turns on LED and plays wav file.
